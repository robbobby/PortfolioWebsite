            <h2>About Me</h2>
            An enthusiastic Software Developer, with a passion for solving problems through technology and creative collaboration.
            My background in construction as a structural technician motivated me to retrain myself as a Software Engineer, as both fields require thought and resourcefulness when designing and implementing plans.
            < p >
                The industries seem a contrast, but my passion in them is the same.Building.Which led me to CodeClan where through collaboration, a diverse set of tutors and colleagues reinforced the value of approaching problems from many angles.
